W1D3 Continuous Integration/Deployment - Jenkins

Jenkins is a CI tool
Continuous Integration
  - gets triggered by source code commits
  - run any tests for frontend or backend code
    - regression testing: if you find a bug, and fix the bug, write a test to make sure you fixed it
  - builds any artifacts
  - publishes the artifacts
  - triggers a deploy in Opsworks
  - many CI systems are configured by a config file in the source code repo
  - can build multiple branches and only deploy specfic branches to specfic environments

  - CI tool connects with some form of source control and links it to a deployment system
  - CI gets triggered by git commit or git pull
  - builds the final working files of the working system
  - build like webpack
  - it builds any artifacts (production js files, rails assets)
  - sacred artifacts are source code that cannot be changed because it's the standard
  - In Jenkins, you do it through the UI
    - for the others, you use a single configuration file (yml) that will do it

  -Icons if CI:
    - CodeShip
    - Travis CI
    - Solano Labs
    - Circle CI
    - Jenkins
      - only one that is not a SASS product.
      - Jenkins is open source and more difficult/robust
      - Java

Jenkins
  - open source pluggable build workflow manager with a web UI
  - plugins and public plugin repository allow Jenkins to be integrated with many services
  - projects are configured in workflow stages
    - source control
    - build steps
    - post build steps
  - each stage of the workflow can impact the next step (e.g. on failure)
  - project can be configured to trigger each other
  - the web UI shows a dashboard that can visualize build status as well as test results


  - build environment
    - issues with version locking
      - in the gem files, you must specify the version number or every new version will break your code
    - rvm allows you to have 2 versions of ruby and you can switch between
  - build tab

  (Might have to rename the databases)
  - ON TERMINAL: config/database.yml

  - rails divides static assets and dynamic ones
  - takes all the images out and puts it in a public directory



Jenkins - Source Control
 - can work with many diff source control systems
 - github uses web hooks (http requests)
 - jenkin github plugin can support github webhooks
 - can be configured to only run on certain branches
