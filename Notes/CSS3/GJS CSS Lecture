Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)
 - allows several style sheets to influence the doc
 - priority scheme resolves conflicts of different declarations
 - allows us to separate content from presentation

SCSS
 - an extension of CSS
 - variables
      ex. $primary-color: #333;
          $font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
          body {
          }
 - nesting
      ex. nav {
            ul {
              margin: 0;
              padding: 0;
              list-style: none;
            }
          }
 - importing partials

Selectors
 - selectors are patterns used to select HTML elements
    section.   class
    section#   id
    section*   direct or nested child
    section,
    (space)
    >
    section +   siblings
    section ~   siblings same except it doesn't have to follow
    [type=submit] type of
    :hover  pseudo-selector

Specificity Hierarchy
  - inherited styles
  - universal styles *
  - element and pseudo-elements
    ::before
      - can say content: "and some string" and it'll add that to everything before the element
    ::after
  - classes, attributes and pseudo-classes

  - avoid inline styling and the !important flag
  - combinators have no effect on specificity  (+ , ~)

  - in-line style > id > class

HTML Box Model - everything in HTML is a box
CSS Box Model
  - default property for certain tags
  - margin
      border
        padding
          content
  - overwrite with box-sizing: border-box;
    - will subtract border and padding from the total width/height to make styling simpler
    - recommendation: add to the css reset file

Display
  display: block
    always starts on a  new line
    full width
    can set width and height
  display: in-line
    does not start on a new line
    only take as much width as necessary
    width and height setting has no effect
  display: in-line block
    flows with surrounding text. does not start on a new line
    can set width and height
  display: none;
    used to hide/show content
  display: flex;
    flexbox(flexible box) - easier to layout, align and distribute space among items in a container
    flex-grow: 1;
      - the children maintain proportionate widths are responsive to the parent size
    flex-wrap: wrap;
      - children after given a min width, will wrap around as needed

Demo
  ON TERMINAL:
  gem install sass
  sass --watch main.scss:style.css
    - sass is now watching for changes

example on main.scss
  @import 'partials/reset';
    - use this to add the reset easily

Bootstrap
  - open source professional design that is easy to add
  - responsive design
  - used by a lot of companies in production
  - CSS Grid does a lot what sass was originally designed to do

  on your main html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/more string here"
  <script src="https://maccdn.bootstrapcdn.com/more bootstrap's html"

  - principles of good design:
    - mobile first

Media Query
  example:
    500 pixels and wider we want two columns
    html, body {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
    }
    @media screen and (min-width: 500px) {
      .col {
        float: left;
        width: 50vw;
      }
    }

    1000 pixels and wider we want 3 columns
    @media screen and (min-width: 1000px) {
      .col {
        width: 33.33vw;
      }
    }
