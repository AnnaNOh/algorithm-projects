1. Name two programming paradigms important for JavaScript app developers
JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language and can support imperative/procedural programming along with OOP(Object Oriented Programming) and functional programming.
- Imperative/Procedural Programming (Prototypal inheritance)
- Functional programming

2. Functional programming
Functional programming produces programs by composing mathematical functions and avoids shared state & mutable data.
Lisp (made in 1958) was one of the first languages to support functional programming and was inspired by lambda calculus.

3. Difference between Classical inheritance and Prototypal inheritance
Class Inheritance: Instances inherit from classes and create sub-class relationships. Instances are instantiated by constructor functions with the "new" keyword.
Prototypal Inheritance: Instances inherit directly from other objects. Instances are instantiated by factory functions or Object.create(). Instances are composed from many different objects allowing for easy selective inheritance.
