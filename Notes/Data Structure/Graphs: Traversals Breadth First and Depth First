Graph is:
A - B - F - C - H
      - E - (E and G)
  - G
  - D - (D and F)


Depth First Search
Result: A B E G

Stack:
G -> no more unvisited. so pop off stack
E -> no more unvisited. so pop off stack.
B -> F is left. push F onto stack. add F to visited(result)
A

Once stack is empty, traversal is complete

Start with a point.
Add it to result.
Add it to the stack.
Add one of its children to the stack and result.
Check child's children add to stack and result.
Until child has no child.
Then push off stack until there is a child unvisited.
Stop once stack is empty.


Breadth First Search
Result: A B D G E
Queue: B D G E F

Check A.
Add its children to queue (B, D, G)
Then check the first in queue, B.
Add its children to result and queue (F)
Then pop off B from queue.
Then check D who was next in queue. D doesn't have anything. Pop off D.
Continue til queue is empty.
