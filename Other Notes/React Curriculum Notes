React 

A Brief History 
Facebook made XHP, a PHP(Hypertext Preprocessor) that integrated XML-like language and could defend against Cross Site Scripting(XSS) attacks. 
XHP could condense entire PHP elements into single HTML-like tags that could be used elsewhere in the codebase, but its performance was terrible. 

React was made when they had the idea to use XHP's integration of XML-like syntax and tags in a JavaScript library.
It was first used in 2011 by Facebook. 

React and Angular are one of the most popular libraries for front-end development. 


Concepts
Single Page App - has only one backend route that renders HTML. Asynchronous Ajax requests send and retrieve information to the backend and React updates the relevant portion of the page. 
Virtual DOM - DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree structure where each node represents an HTML element. Virtual DOM is a simpler and faster abstraction of the HTML DOM. 
Diffing Algorithm - 
JSX - 
Enzyme and Jest - 

Other frameworks and libraries
jQuery - most popular JavaScript library in use, allows developers to manipulate the DOM
Vue - 
Angular - 
Ember - 
React Native
