DATA STRUCTURES
linear data structures
 - array
 - linked list
 - stack (first in, first out)
 - queue (first in, last out)

non-linear data structures
 - tree (hierarchical data structure)
 - graph


GRAPHS
graph: nodes and vertices connected by edges
-Trees have for (n) nodes (n-1) edges and 1 parent. There must be one parent for each child. Graphs do not have these rules.

-Graph (G) is an ordered pair of a set of (V) of vertices and a set (E) of edges.
G = (V, E)
ordered pairs: (a,b) != (b,a) if a != b
unordered pairs: {a.b} = {b,a}

V = {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8}

Edges can be directed or undirected.
directed: u -> v
undirected: u <-> v
E = { {v1, v2} {v1,v3}, {v1, v4}, {v2, v5}, }

Digraph: a directed graph
Undirected graph (no special name for this)
