Life of a React Component 
  Birth (pre-mounting)

  willMount
  didMount
  willReceiveProps
  shouldUpdate
  willUpdate
  render
  didUpdate
  willUnmount

  Death(unmounting)

componentWillMount 
  Before component appears on the screen.
  Not much to do because there is no component to play with yet, so can't do anything with the DOM
  Nothing should have changed since your component's constructor was called, which is where you should be setting up your 
  component's default configuration anyway.
  -Only exception is any setup that can only be done at runtime 
  -DO NOT use to setState
 
 componentDidMount 
  Load data here. Because, there is no guarantee that AJAX request won't resolve before the component mounts, but it is guaranteed here
  Do all the setup. (ex. draw on <canvas> elements. Initialize a masonry grid layout. Add event listeners.)
 
 componentWillReceiveProps
  has access to both next props(nextProps) and current props(this.props) 
  
  You should:
  1. check which props will change (big flaw of componentWillReceiveProps is that it's sometimes called when nothing has changed; 
  React just wants to check in)
  2. If the props will change significantly, act on it
  
  Example Code:
    componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
      if (this.props.percent !== nextProps.percent) {
        this.setUpCircle(nextProps.percent)
      }
    }
  Another caveat of componentWillReceiveProps is that it's not called on initial render.
  
  shouldComponentUpdate
