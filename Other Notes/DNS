DNS is often called the backbone of the internet.

If it's the first time the user has gone to this website, 
This happens when you type google.com in the browser:
1. A user asks their browser to visit google.com
2. Browser queries a DNS Resovler (usually their ISP) where's google.com?
3. DNS Resolver queries the Root servers  "where is .COM?" Redirects to another domain name server(in this Verisign)
4. DNS Resolver now queries Verisign "where is google.com?" Redirects with the IP address 
5. Hosting servers are queried with the IP address. "Give me the files for IP address ---.----.---.-"
6. Website files are delivered and rendered on the page

IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) - organization that maps domain names and IP address 
ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) - organization that provides the technical operations of vital DNS resoursces and defines the policies 
for how the names and numbers of the Internet should run.

ICANN believe that all users of the Internet deserve a say in how it's run. Wide variety of representatives
