DBMS lets users create, read, update and delete data in a database.
DBMS serves as an interface between the database and end users or application programs.

DBMS manages 3 things:
1. data
2. database engine - allows data to be accessed, locked and modified
  - engine - a program that performs a core or essential function for other programs. can also refer to a special purpose program that uses deep learning algorithms to query data.
3. database schema - defines the database's logical structure
These 3 help provide concurrency(parallel processing), security, data integrity(assurance that data is uncorrupted and can only be accessed/modified by those authorized to do so), and uniform administration procedures.
DBMS supports typical database admin tasks such as change management(systematic approach to dealing with transition or transformation of an organization's goals, proceses or technologies), performance monitoring/tuning, and backup and recovery.
DBMS are also responsible for automated rollbacks, restarts, recovery, logging and auditing of activity.

DBMS's major function is providing a centralized view of data that can be accessed by multiple users, from multiple locations and in a controlled manner.
  - can limit what data the end user sees and how they view the data
  - end users and software programs don't have to know where the data is physically located or on what type of storage media it resides because the DBMS handles all the requests

DBMS can offer both logical and physical data independence. Users and applications do not need to know where data is stored or care about changes to the physical structure of the data (storage and hardware)
  - Programs instead use API (application programming interface) for the database provided by the DBMS

Relational DBMSs (RDBMSs)'s API is SQL


Popular types of DBMSes
- Popular database models and their management systems:
    - Relational database management system (RDBMS) - adaptable to most use cases but RDBMS Tier-1 products can be expensive
    - NoSQL DBMS - good for loosely defined data structures that may evolve over time
    - In-memory database management system (IMDBMS) - provides faster response times and better performance
    - Columnar database management system (CDBMS) - good for data warehouses(physical or logical federated repository for all the data that an enterprise's various business systems collect) that have a large number of similar data items
    - Cloud-based data management system - cloud service provider is responsible for providing and maintaining the DBMS


Advantages of a DBMS
- Biggest advantage - lets end users and application programmers access and use the same data while managing data integrity
