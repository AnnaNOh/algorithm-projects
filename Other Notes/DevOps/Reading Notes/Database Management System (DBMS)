DBMS lets users create, read, update and delete data in a database.
DBMS serves as an interface between the database and end users or application programs.

DBMS manages 3 things:
1. data
2. database engine - allows data to be accessed, locked and modified
3. database schema - defines the database's logical structure
These 3 help provide concurrency, security, data integrity, and uniform administration procedures.
DBMS supports typical database admin tasks such as change management, performance monitoring/tuning, and backup and recovery.
DBMS are also responsible for automated rollbacks, restarts, recovery, logging and auditing of activity.
