AWS

Not going to use physical hardware but cloud services.
Most startups are working on AWS.

AWS
- AWS allows you to get access to computing hardware, and pay per hour
- They offer many different machine sizes (different resource allocations) at different pricing rates
- On top of this base offering, there are many different services available
- Other services though are typically just convenience or utility on top of these servers
- S3 is a little different, its storage that's pay per data transfer and storage used
- Most AWS services use open source technology at their core

  Cloud Services. Take a server you don't own and get access to it for some time.
  Need dedicated machines for streaming media. Otherwise, virtual machine is prob fine.
  5 cents an hour for their base line instance.

  EC2 is a way to get access to a physical hardware.
  All the other services are built on EC2.
  RDS does ..
  S3 is a distributed storage system.


Regions
  - everything except S3 in AWS is specific to a region
  - AWS has data centers around the world and each is managed independently
  - For us in California, there are 2 data centers close to us
  - Of these, Oregon (us-west-2) is the cheapest (over N. California)
  - Make sure to always double check your region when you log in!

  S3 distributes all your data around the world, so it's global. It's the one exception.


When launching an instance
1. choose AMI
2. choose instance type
  general purpose is all t2 and m
  probably can get away with t2.small
3. put everything on default
    network -> default
    subnet -> no preference
    auto-assign public ip -> use subnet setting (enable)
    IAM -> none


EC2 - Key Pairs
  - EC2 uses SSH keys to grant you access to the instances you create
  - On new instance creation, you'll be asked to select a key
  - You can upload an existing public key, to which you have the private (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
  - or allow AWS to create a new one and download the private key

  - you can remotely get into another machine as if you're using the terminal on that computer by using the ssh
  - they use encryption for this
  - keys come in a public and private half. if you have the private number, you can prove to the public user that you have the private key.

  ON TERMINAL: ls -al ~/.ssh/

  $ ssh -i ~/.ssh/key.pem ubuntu@<public_ip>
  example: ssh -i ~/ .ssh/mac.pem ubuntu@34.212.31.144

  open ssl
  open ssl genrsa


EC2-Volumes (EBS)
  - think of AWS as every machine having an external hard drive?
  - network attached storage (NAS)
  - volume (ebs - elastic block storage)
    - can only be plugged into one machine at a time
  - instance storage - only stores temp. if you turn it off, nothing will persist

  - by default, instances created are completely clean, and any data stored will not persist are machine termination
  - you can add persistent storage to any instance using EBS Volumes
  - Volumes will be auto-mounted in ubuntu under /mount/
  - A volume can only be attached to a single instance at a time
  - We will not be using EBS storage during our exercises


EC2 - Load Balancers
  - AWS offers load balancers known as ELBs (elastic load balancers)
  - ELBs allow you to add instances to the pool of machines
  - Many services integrate with ELBs and will auto-add
  - ELBs allow you to configure request routing via inbound prot/protocol and output port/protocol
  - ELBs can automatiaclly check the health of an instance by requesting a configurealble URL and consdiering 2XX status code healthy

  - ELBs have auto health check and integrate with the other services
  - spooky is his(Gene's) app name
  - every 30 seconds the ELB makes an HTTP request to make a health check. 200 requests are healthy. If it isn't 200, then it will send it to a different machine.
  - So on load balancer's listeners
    - If you get a request from port 80, send back to 80
    - If you get a HTTPS request on 443, use the SSL certificate to handshake, but then use 80 (public) for the parts behind it


EC2 - Security Groups
  - Security Groups are applied to all instances and ELBs
  - They are similar to a firewall and restrict all traffic destined to that machine according to configurable rules

  - frustrating
  - in security group, for inbound, add a new rule
    - for that new port range
    - if the source was 0.0.0.0/0 if means for any IP address
    - he had two for 1 rule, because 1 is for IPv4 and the other IPv6


EC2 - VPCs
  - VPSc are analagous to an office network
  - Inside the VPC, machines can access each other via na internal IP
  - Outside, machines are accessible according to sec group rules
  - We will be using the default VPS setting for all of the exercises

  - fakes a small network and makes a new IP address that the machines in the fake network can use
  - much faster because they are proximally located


RDS
  - RDS is a utility to automatically setup an EC2 instance, with a database service running on it
  - RDS offers Mysql, Progres, Oracle, SQL Server and others
  - RDS also enables you to configure the database settings via the UI
  - RDS can also be used for common database maintenance tasks, such as backups, creating slave dbs, or restoring snapshots

  -Snapshots are Amazon's word for backups. They do it everyday around 5AM

  - When things break usually the first thing to go is the database!
  - Amazon has a thing where you can make read replicas. (master slaves).
    - Literally, RDS -> instance -> right drop down tab with the words Read Replica


S3
  - S3 is a distributed file storage system
  - You can upload files via the AWS API
  - Files can be private or public
  - S3 is outside of region settings


CloudFront
  - is a distributed CDN (proxy)
  - It is outside of the region settings
  - Can be configured to serve content from an application server or an S3 bucket
  - Can be configured to use a custom domain
  - Expiry/Invalidation of cached content can be configured
  - Invalidation can also be caused by API

  - When deploying, you gotta have the CDN delete all your cache or your code won't work as intended


Certificate Manager
  - the certificate manager stores any SSL certificates that you wish to use in other AWS services
  - We will be using this to enable HTTPS in our application
